# Auth Now

> An exploration into serverless

This is the main repo for @tomfa, @andrroy and @rix1's serverless adventure

## Api Reference

<!-- If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters. -->

Currently, the API only supports `GET` requests.

- `GET /api/hello?name=world` ðŸ‘‰ Hello world!
- `GET /api/sendgrid/send/test@info.com` ðŸ‘‰ Send email using [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) as provider to test@info.com.

  Specify subject and body using query parameters. Example `GET /api/sendgrid/send/test@info.com?title=Hello&text=how%20is%20it%20going?`

- `GET /api/mailgun/send/test@info.com` ðŸ‘‰ Send email using [MailGun](https://www.mailgun.com) as provider to test@info.com.

  Specify subject and body using query parameters. Example `GET /api/mailgun/send/test@info.com?title=Hello&text=how%20is%20it%20going?`

## Developing

### Built With

This project defines a series of serverless functions to be hosted by [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/).

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Node and `now` installedd globally:

- `Node >=8.x`
- `npm install -g now`

### Setting up Dev

To get started, clone the repo and install dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rix1/auth-now.git
cd auth-now/
yarn install
```

### Building

Before building, you need to copy `dev-template.env` to `.env`

```shell
cp dev-template.env .env
```

#### API keys

You need to create API keys for the email providers you wish to support. Currently [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/) and [Mailgun](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart.html) is supported.

#### Private JWT Key

You also need to generate a private JWT key to sign the JWT payload. Just create a random passphrase 1Password or OpenSSL:

```shell
openssl rand -base64 32
```

ZEIT Now provides an additional command with Now CLI to help you develop serverless functions locally by replicating the production environment on Now
with your localhost.

```shell
now dev
```

This supports hot reloading.

### Deploying / Publishing

To deploy serverless functions you just have to run

```shell
now
```

from the root directory of the project. This will upload the repository to
ZEIT's servers, build the project and serve the serverless API functions at
https://auth-now.rix1.now.sh/api/.

#### Secrets

Before deploying, you need to set secrets in your production environment:

```shell
now secrets add <secret-name> <secret-value>
```

See [Now's docs](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/environment-variables-and-secrets/) and their [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/zeit/now/blob/master/errors/missing-env-file.md) for more information.

## Configuration

You can configure the build and deployment settings in `now.json`. See
[ZEIT docs](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/advanced/configuration/) for API reference
and more info.

### Aliases

You can easily alias you deployment to different domains. See
[custom domains](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/custom-domains/#deploying-with-your-domain)
for more info.

## Tests

Todo

<!-- Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
``` -->
